**KNOW YO FRO**

By: [Chris Flannagan](https://whoischris.com)

This is a simple php app for making a quiz based on a json file of images and labels

Originally built to be a quiz for identifying afros

**SETUP**
npm install
gulp

**_NOTES_**

This shit is seriously weird at points.  I'm not a json expert and I managed
to build the data out so when pulled into php and parsed it's an array of arrays
instead of key => value for fro image and fro answer.

This made some of my code look terrible like loops within loops just to get the
key => val of the options

I also did this super fast so please feel free to make it better.  Being so simple I didn't
get all crazy with the css.  It's plain jane bootstrap and just straight forward.
